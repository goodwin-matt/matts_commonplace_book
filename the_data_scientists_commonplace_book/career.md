Four takeways:

1. The advertised map is not the true territory. 
- What we see on blogs, interviews, etc. is not what real day to day life is like.
2. Building machine learning systems is building software.
- Building software isn't glamorous, it's real work, and it has to be done.
3. Even advanced work deals with normal problems. Fancy models still need to be served.
4. Solid fundamentals build to advanced work. Cut past the media noise to learn the fundamentals.
