## REST APIs

- REST stands for "representatiional state transfer". Not a technology but an archetectural specification or paradigm.
- API stands for "application programming interface"
    - "a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program enabling interaction bewteen the software and other items, such as other software or hardware" - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API  
- URI: refers to a resource, URL is a subset of the URI and also tells us how to get that resource.  
- Six constraints of REST
    1. Client/Server distinction (allows server to serve multiple clients)
    2. Statelessness (state can't be stored on the server, client is in charge of that)
    3. Cacheability (must mark REST responses as cacheable or non-cacheable)
    4. Layered system (client doesn't care what its connecting to)
    5. Code on demand (can pass code)
    6. Uniform interface
- The world wide web is just one of many services on the internet (email, streaming, etc. being others)
- A RESTful API is a REST API that is accessed through http.
