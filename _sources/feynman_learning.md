## Feynman Method For Learning

I'm learning more about Richard Feynman, but what I've learned 
so far is really impressive. I like his attitude towards
intelligence and learning; namely that he claims he wasn't anyone special but 
someone who studied really hard.

Here is [one link](https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique) that I think does a good job summarizing this learning
method. I'm practicing this method by using it to learn it below!

There are 4 main steps to this method.

1. Pick a topic and write it at the top of the page. Make sure it is narrow 
enough. You can't write down an entire Biology book for example.
   
2. From your memory, write down what you know about the subject. Teach it to yourself.
Better yet try and teach it to someone else. This forces you to see where
   your gaps might be, since if you can't teach it easily, you may need to learn
   more.
   
3. Go back to the source material and fill in the gaps. Learning is iterative.

4. See how to simplify the material. Simplicity forces you to understand 
the material. Try to create an analogy as well, this helps with recall
   and understanding.
