## Imposter Syndrome

- A well written personal experience of imposter syndrome from a statistician professor:

- This one is really well done - https://daleonai.com/my-take-imposter-syndrome-tech. Couple of key points I liked:
	- Common advice with imposter syndrome to just stop or to just fake it may not be advisable. You can't fake being confident, it comes across as disingenius and it doesn't address the problem. 
		- Focus on acquiring "true confidence" the kind by brain and gut agree on. This doesn't mean going back to get a PhD.
	- How to do this
		- Calibrate yourself: find objective ways to understand where you sit. Other people are comfortable talking like an expert on something they read about for 5 minutes, this could give you the impression your further behind than you really are. Interviewing is a good way of calibration because you talk to people who inflate their resume. Lines of code committed, performance reviews, candid conversation with manager can all be useful.
		- Talk the talk: other people will inflate their skills even if their own your level. If you hold yourself to a higher bar then you are actually misleading others as well because you are using a different scale. Don't undercut yourself, don't need to inflate your knowledge but don't kill your credibility.
		- Understand that jerks will talk down to you about something you don't know but remember Richard Feynman doesn't know what Kubernetes is. You always deserve to be spoken to like a smart person.

Four takeways:

1. The advertised map is not the true territory. 
- What we see on blogs, interviews, etc. is not what real day to day life is like.
2. Building machine learning systems is building software.
- Building software isn't glamorous, it's real work, and it has to be done.
3. Even advanced work deals with normal problems. Fancy models still need to be served.
4. Solid fundamentals build to advanced work. Cut past the media noise to learn the fundamentals.
