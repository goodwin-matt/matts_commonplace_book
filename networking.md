## IP Addresses

- Each computer has an IP address. IPv4 is the binary IP address in decimal form.
- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a way to specify a range of addresses.
    - This notation has the IPv4 address written out but then with a backslash and a number. This number tells you how many of the bits are fixed.
