# Matt's Commonplace Book

A general repository of notes, links, and other useful bits of information that I want 
to remember and that may be useful to others.

### What is a commonplace book?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)
commonplace books "are a way to compile knowledge". The concept goes back 
to ancient times and provides a means for people to collect different items 
such as notes or quotes. 

### Why a commonplace book?

I was drawn to the concept of a commonplace book for a few reasons:

1. I learn and retain better when I write and write to teach. A public commonplace 
book helps force me to be more thorough in my learning and more clear in my writing.
   
2. I find myself looking up the same pieces of information over and over and having 
a central location for me personally to go will help me be more efficient.
   
3. I can share my understanding around certain topics better with others by pointing 
to a specific page of this book.
   
4. Less pressure to produce content like blogging. More of a way to keep track of 
what is important to me.
   

### What is in this commonplace book

Mainly notes, thoughts, and links around subjects such as data science, machine learning,
computer science, and career related items. But anything is on the table :)
